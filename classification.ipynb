It implements the  framework set out in ‘Maintaining High Professional Standards in the Modern NHS’,  issued under the direction of the Secretary of State for Health on 11 February 2005.  This agreement supercedes TPP 408 ‘Formal Disciplinary Procedure for Senior  Medical and Dental Staff’.    This procedure may be amended to reflect any future national advice or guidance but  only by agreement with the LNC. Where there is any conflict or lack of clarity the  existing national agreed guidance will take precedence. The operation of the  procedure in practice will be reviewed after [2] years from the date indicated at the  end of the document.     [Note: There are numerous references throughout this procedure to the National  Clinical Assessment Service. The NCAS was known as the National Clinical  Assessment Authority until 1 April 2005].    1  ACTION WHEN A CONCERN ARISES    Introduction    1.1.  The management of performance is a continuous process which is intended  to identify problems. Numerous ways now exist in which concerns about a  practitioner\\'s performance can be identified; through which remedial and  supportive action can be quickly taken before problems become serious or  patients harmed; and which need not necessarily require formal investigation  or the resort to disciplinary procedures.     1.2.  Concerns about a doctor or dentist\\'s conduct or capability can come to light in  a wide variety of ways, for example:  •  Concerns expressed by other NHS professionals, health care managers,  students and non-clinical staff;   •  Review of performance against job plans, annual appraisal, revalidation   •  Monitoring of data on performance and quality of care;   •  Clinical governance, clinical audit and other quality improvement  activities;   •  Complaints about care by patients or relatives of patients;   •  Information from the regulatory bodies;   •  Litigation following allegations of negligence;   •  Information from the police or coroner;   •  Court judgements.     1.3.  Unfounded and malicious allegations can cause lasting damage to a doctor\\'s  reputation and career prospects. Therefore all allegations, including those  made by relatives of patients, or concerns raised by colleagues, must be  properly investigated to verify the facts so that the allegations can be shown    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  4 to be true or false. ( see TPP 418 – Concerns at Work (“Whistleblowing” and  TPP417 – Concerns about Patient Care).   1.4.  Concerns about the capability of doctors and dentists in training should be  considered initially as training issues and the postgraduate dean should be  involved from the outset.  1.5.  All serious concerns must be registered with the Chief Executive and he or  she must ensure that a case manager is appointed. For a consultant or  Associate Specialist, this will be the Medical Director and for Staff Grade and  junior/training grade doctors may be a Clinical Director. The Chairman of the  Board must designate a non-executive member \"the designated member\" to  oversee the case and ensure that momentum is maintained. All concerns  should be investigated quickly and appropriately. A clear audit route must be  established for initiating and tracking progress of the investigation, its costs  and resulting action. However the issue is raised, the Medical Director  will  need to work with the Director of Human Resources to decide the appropriate  course of action in each case. The Medical Director will act as the case  manager in cases involving clinical directors and consultants and may  delegate this role to a senior manager to oversee the case on his or her  behalf in other cases. The Medical Director is responsible for appointing a  case investigator who will be supported by a senior member of the  HR  department.  Where patient safety is an issue, for  a consultant or Associate  Specialist, the case investigator will be medically qualified.  If it is a matter of  conduct, wherever possible this will be a medically qualified person, though it  may be a General Manager where that is acceptable to the practitioner.  Exclusion  1.6.  When serious concerns are raised about a practitioner, the Trust will urgently  consider whether it is necessary to place temporary restrictions on their  practice. This might be to amend or restrict their clinical duties, obtain  undertakings or provide for the exclusion of the practitioner from the  workplace. Section 2 of this document sets out the procedures for this action.  1.7.  At any point in the process where the case manager has reached the clear  judgement that a practitioner is considered to be a serious potential danger to  patients or staff, that practitioner must be referred to the GMC/GDC, whether  or not the case has been referred to the National Clinical Assessment Service  (formerly the NCAA). Consideration should also be given to whether the issue  of an alert letter should be requested.    Identifying if there is a problem    1.8.  The first task of the case manager is to identify the nature of the problem or  concern and to assess the seriousness of the issue on the information  available and the likelihood that it can be resolved without resort to formal  disciplinary procedures. This is a difficult decision and should not be taken  alone but in consultation with the Director/Head of Human Resources and the  Medical Director and the National Clinical Assessment Service. The NCAS  asks that the first approach to them should be made by the Chief Executive or  Medical Director.  1.9.  The case managers should explore the potential problem with the NCAS to  consider different ways of tackling it themselves, possibly recognise the    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  5 problem as being more to do with work systems than doctor performance, or  see a wider problem needing the involvement of an outside body other than  the NCAS.   1.10. The case manager should not automatically attribute an incident to the  actions, failings or acts of an individual alone.   Root-cause analyses of  adverse events should be conducted as these frequently show that causes  are more broadly based and can be attributed to systems or organisational  failures, or demonstrate that they are untoward outcomes which could not  have been predicted and are not the result of any individual or systems  failure. Each will require appropriate investigation and remedial actions. The  National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) facilitates the development of an  open and fair culture, which encourages doctors, dentists and other NHS staff  to report adverse incidents and other near misses and the case manager  should consider contacting the NPSA for advice about systems or  organisational failures.    1.11. Having discussed the case with the NCAS and/or NPSA, the case manager  must decide whether an informal approach can be taken to address the  problem, or whether a formal investigation will be needed. Where an informal  route is chosen the NCAS should still be involved until the problem is  resolved.   1.12.  Where it is decided that a more formal route needs to be followed (perhaps  leading to conduct or capability proceedings) the Medical Director must, after  discussion between the Chief Executive and Director of Human Resources,  appoint an appropriately experienced or trained person as case investigator.  The seniority of the case investigator will differ depending on the grade of  practitioner involved in the allegation. Several clinical managers should be  appropriately trained, to enable them to carry out this role when required.  1.13. The case investigator:  •  Is responsible for leading the investigation into any allegations or  concerns about a practitioner, establishing the facts and reporting the  findings;  •  Must formally involve a senior member of the medical or dental staff  nominated by the medical staff committee chair [or equivalent] where a  question of clinical judgement is raised during the investigation process.  (Where no other suitable senior doctor or dentist is employed by the Trust  a senior doctor or dentist from another NHS body should be approached);  •  Must ensure that safeguards are in place throughout the investigation so  that breaches of confidentiality are avoided as far as possible. Patient  confidentiality needs to be maintained but any disciplinary panel will need  to know the details of the allegations. It is the responsibility of the case  investigator to judge what information needs to be gathered and how -  within the boundaries of the law - that information should be gathered.  The investigator will approach the practitioner concerned to seek views on  information that should be collected;  •  Must ensure that there are sufficient written statements collected to  establish a case prior to a decision to convene any disciplinary panel,  and on aspects of the case not covered by a written statement, ensure  that oral evidence is given sufficient weight in the investigation report;     TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  6 •  Must ensure that a written record is kept of the investigation, the  conclusions reached and the course of action agreed by the Director of  Human Rescources  with the Medical Director;  •  Must assist the designated Board member in reviewing the progress of  the case.     The Investigation  1.14. The case investigator does not make the decision on what action should be  taken nor whether the employee should be excluded from work and may not  be a member of any disciplinary or appeal panel relating to the case.   1.15. The practitioner concerned must be informed in writing by the case manager,  as soon as it has been decided, that an investigation is to be undertaken, the  name of the case investigator and made aware of the specific allegations or  concerns that have been raised. The practitioner must be given the  opportunity to see any correspondence relating to the case together with a list  of the people that the case investigator will interview. The practitioner must  also be afforded the opportunity to put their view of events to the case  investigator and given the opportunity to be accompanied.   1.16. At any stage of this process - or subsequent disciplinary action - the  practitioner may be accompanied in any interview or hearing by a companion.  In addition to statutory rights under the Employment Act 1999, the companion  may be another employee of the NHS body; an official or representative of  the British Medical Association [,any other recognised trade union], British  Dental Association or a defence organisation; or a friend, partner or spouse.  The companion may be legally qualified but he or she will not be acting in a  legal capacity.   1.17.  The case investigator has discretion on how the investigation is carried out  but in all cases the purpose of the investigation is to ascertain the facts in an  unbiased manner. Investigations are not intended simply to secure evidence  against the practitioner as information gathered in the course of an  investigation may clearly exonerate the practitioner or provide a sound basis  for effective resolution of the matter.  1.18. If during the course of the investigation it transpires that the case involves  more complex clinical issues than first anticipated, the case manager should  arrange for a practitioner in the same specialty and same grade from another  NHS body to assist.   1.19  The case investigator should complete the investigation within 4 weeks of  appointment and submit their report to the case manager within a further 5  days. The report of the investigation should give the case manager sufficient  information to make a decision whether:  •  There is a case of misconduct that should be put to a conduct panel;   •  There are concerns about the practitioner\\'s health that should be  considered by the NHS body\\'s occupational health service;   •  There are concerns about the practitioner\\'s performance that should be  further explored by the NCAS;   •  Restrictions on practice or exclusion from work should be considered;   •  There are serious concerns that should be referred to the GMC or GDC;   •  There are intractable problems and the matter should be put before a  capability panel;     TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  7 •  No further action is needed.       Involvement of the NCAS following local investigation  1.20. Medical under-performance can be due to health problems, difficulties in the  work environment, behaviour or a lack of clinical capability. These may occur  in isolation or in a combination. The NCAS\\'s processes are aimed at  addressing all of these, particularly where local action has not been able to  take matters forward successfully. The NCAS\\'s methods of working therefore  assume commitment by all parties to take part constructively in a referral to  the NCAS. For example, its assessors work to formal terms of reference,  decided on after input from the doctor and the referring body.  1.21. The focus of the NCAS’s work is therefore likely to involve performance  difficulties which are serious and/or repetitive. That means:  •  Performance falling well short of what doctors and dentists could be  expected to do in similar circumstances and which, if repeated, would put  patients seriously at risk;  •  Alternatively or additionally, problems that are ongoing or (depending on  severity) have been encountered on at least two occasions.   In cases where it becomes clear that the matters at issue focus on fraud,  specific patient complaints or organisational governance, their further  management may warrant a different local process. The NCAS may advise  on this.  1.22.  Where Heatherwood & Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust is considering  excluding a doctor or dentist (whether or not his or her performance is under  discussion with the NCAS), the Trust will inform the NCAS of this at an early  stage, so that alternatives to exclusion are considered. Procedures for  exclusion are covered in section 2 of the procedure. It is particularly desirable  to find an alternative when the NCAS is likely to be involved, because it is  much more difficult to assess a doctor who is excluded from practice than one  who is working.  1.23.  A practitioner undergoing assessment by the NCAS must cooperate with any  request to give an undertaking not to practise in the NHS or private sector  other than their main place of NHS employment until the NCAS assessment  is complete. (Under circular HSC 2002/011, Annex 1, paragraph 3, \"A doctor  undergoing assessment by the NCAA[S] must give a binding undertaking not  to practise in the NHS or private sector other than in their main place of NHS  employment until the assessment process is complete”).  1.24.  Failure to co-operate with a referral to the NCAS may be seen as evidence of  a lack of willingness on the part of the doctor or dentist to work with the  employer on resolving performance difficulties. If the practitioner chooses not  to co-operate with such a referral, that may limit the options open to the  parties and may necessitate disciplinary action and consideration of referral to  the GMC or GDC.        TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  8     Confidentiality  1.25.  The Trust and its employees will maintain confidentiality at all times. No press  notice will be issued, nor the name of the practitioner released, in regard to  any investigation or hearing into disciplinary matters. The employer will only  confirm publicly that an investigation or disciplinary hearing is underway.   1.26.  Personal data released to the case investigator for the purposes of the  investigation must be fit for the purpose, nor disproportionate to the  seriousness of the matter under investigation. The trust will operate  consistently with the guiding principles of the Data Protection Act.  Transitional arrangements  1.27.  At the time of the implementation of this procedure, a case manager will be  appointed for all existing cases and the new procedures followed as far as is  practical taking into account the stage the case has reached. Where, in the  view of the Trust, an existing case could not be effectively resolved using this  framework and a disciplinary process began before the Directions came into  force, an alternative process may be used.    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  9 2  RESTRICTION OF PRACTICE & EXCLUSION FROM WORK    Introduction    2.1.  This part of the procedure replaces the guidance in HSG (94)49.  2.2.  In this part of the procedure, the phrase \"exclusion from work\" has been used  to replace the word \"suspension\" which can be confused with action taken by  the GMC or GDC to suspend the practitioner from the register pending a  hearing of their case or as an outcome of a fitness to practise hearing.  2.3.  The Trust will ensure that:  •  Exclusion from work is used only as an interim measure whilst action to  resolve a problem is being considered;   •  Where a practitioner is excluded, it is for the minimum necessary period of  time: this can be up to but no more than four weeks at a time;   •  All extensions of exclusion are reviewed and a brief report provided to the  Chief Executive and the Board;   •  A detailed report is provided when requested to a single non-executive  member of the Board (the \"Designated Board Member\") who will be  responsible for monitoring the situation until the exclusion has been lifted.    Managing the risk to patients  2.4.   When serious concerns are raised about a practitioner, the Trust will urgently  consider whether it is necessary to place temporary restrictions on their  practice. This might be to amend or restrict their clinical duties, obtain  undertakings or provide for the exclusion of the practitioner from the  workplace. Exclusion will be considered as a last resort if alternative courses  of action are not feasible.   2.5.   Exclusion of clinical staff from the workplace is a temporary expedient.  Exclusion is a precautionary measure and not a disciplinary sanction.  Exclusion from work (\"suspension\") will be reserved for only the most  exceptional circumstances.  2.6.      Exclusion will only be used:  •  To protect the interests of patients or other staff; and/or   •  To assist the investigative process when there is a clear risk that the  practitioner\\'s presence would impede the gathering of evidence.   It is imperative that exclusion from work is not misused or seen as the only  course of action that could be taken. The degree of action must depend on  the nature and seriousness on the concerns and on the need to protect  patients, the practitioner concerned and/or their colleagues.  2.7.   Alternative ways to manage risks, avoiding exclusion, include:  •  Medical or clinical director supervision of normal contractual clinical  duties;     TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  10 •  Restricting the practitioner to certain forms of clinical duties;   •  Restricting activities to administrative, research/audit, teaching and other  educational duties. By mutual agreement the latter might include some  formal retraining or re-skilling;  •  Sick leave for the investigation of specific health problems.   2.8.  In cases relating to the capability of a practitioner, consideration will be given  to whether an action plan to resolve the problem can be agreed with the  practitioner. Advice on the practicality of this approach will be sought from the  NCAS. If the nature of the problem and a workable remedy cannot be  determined in this way, the case manager will seek to agree with the  practitioner to refer the case to the NCAS, which can assess the problem in  more depth and give advice on any action necessary. The case manager will  seek immediate telephone advice from the NCAS when considering  restriction of practise or exclusion.  The Exclusion Process  2.9.   The Trust will not exclude a practitioner for more than four weeks at a time.  The justification for continued exclusion must be reviewed on a regular basis  and before any further four-week period of exclusion is imposed. Key officers  and the Trust Board have responsibilities for ensuring that the process is  carried out quickly and fairly, kept under review and that the total period of  exclusion is not prolonged.  Roles of officers  2.10.  The Trust Chief Executive has overall responsibility for managing exclusion  procedures and for ensuring that cases are properly managed. The decision  to exclude a practitioner must be taken only by persons nominated under  paragraph 2.12. The case will be discussed fully with the Chief Executive, the  Medical Director, the Director of Human Resources, the NCAS and other  interested parties (such as the police where there are serious criminal  allegations or the Counter Fraud & Security Management Service) prior to the  decision to exclude a practitioner. In the rare cases where immediate  exclusion is required, the above parties must discuss the case at the earliest  opportunity following exclusion, preferably at a case conference.  2.11. The authority to exclude  member of  the medical or dental staff is vested in  the Chief Executive, the Medical Director and the Director of Human  Resources.    2.12.  The Medical Director will act as the case manager in the case of consultant  staff, or delegate this role to a senior manager to oversee the case, and  appoint a case investigator to explore and report on the circumstances that  have led to the need to exclude the staff member. The investigating officer will  provide factual information to assist the case manager in reviewing the need  for exclusion and making progress reports to the Chief Executive and  designated Board member.          TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  11 Role of designated Board member  2.13.  At any stage in the process, the practitioner may make representations to the  designated Board member in regard to exclusion, or investigation of a case.  This is in addition to any right the practitioner may have to appeal against the  suspension under the Trust’s appeal procedure (see paragraph 2.41).  The designated Board member must also ensure, among other matters, that  time frames for investigation or exclusion are consistent with the principles of  Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Immediate exclusion  2.14. In exceptional circumstances, an immediate time-limited exclusion may be  necessary for the purposes identified in paragraph 2.6 above following:  •  A critical incident when serious allegations have been made; or   •  There has been a break down in relationships between a colleague and  the rest of the team; or   •  The presence of the practitioner is likely to hinder the investigation.   Such an exclusion will allow a more measured consideration to be undertaken  and the NCAS should be contacted before the immediate exclusion takes  place. This period should be used to carry out a preliminary situation analysis,  to seek further advice from the NCAS and to convene a case conference. The  manager making the exclusion must explain why the exclusion is being made  in broad terms (there may be no formal allegation at this stage) and agree a  date up to a maximum of two weeks away at which the practitioner should  return to the workplace for a further meeting. The case manager must advise  the practitioner of their rights, including rights of representation.  Formal exclusion  2.15.  A formal exclusion may only take place after the case manager has first  considered whether there is a case to answer and then considered, at a case  conference, whether there is reasonable and proper cause to exclude. The  NCAS must be consulted where formal exclusion is being considered. If a  case investigator has been appointed he or she must produce a preliminary  report as soon as is possible to be available for the case conference. This  preliminary report is advisory to enable the case manager to decide on the  next steps as appropriate.  2.16.  The report should provide sufficient information for a decision to be made as  to whether:  •  The allegation appears unfounded; or   •  There is a potential misconduct issue; or   •  There is a concern about the practitioner\\'s capability; or   •  The complexity of the case warrants further detailed investigation before  advice can be given on the way forward and what needs to be inquired  into.   2.17.  Formal exclusion of one or more clinicians must only be used where:    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  12 (a) There is a need to protect the interests of patients or other staff pending  the outcome of a full investigation of:  •  Allegations of misconduct,   •  concerns about serious dysfunctions in the operation of a clinical service,   •  concerns about lack of capability or poor performance of sufficient;   or  (b) The presence of the practitioner in the workplace is likely to hinder the  investigation.  2.18.  Full consideration should be given to whether the practitioner could continue  in or (in cases of an immediate exclusion) return to work in a limited capacity  or in an alternative, possibly non-clinical role, pending the resolution of the  case.  2.19.  When the practitioner is informed of the exclusion, there should be a witness  present and the nature of the allegations or areas of concern should be  conveyed to the practitioner. The practitioner should be told of the reason(s)  why formal exclusion is regarded as the only way to deal with the case. At this  stage the practitioner should be given the opportunity to state their case and  propose alternatives to exclusion (e.g. further training, referral to occupational  health, referral to the NCAS with voluntary restriction).  2.20.  The formal exclusion must be confirmed in writing as soon as is reasonably  practicable. The letter should state the effective date and time, duration (up to  4 weeks), the content of the allegations, the terms of the exclusion (e.g.  exclusion from the premises, see paragraph 2.23, and the need to remain  available for work paragraph 2.24) and that a full investigation or what other  action will follow. The practitioner and their companion should be advised that  they may make representations about the exclusion to the designated board  member at any time after receipt of the letter confirming the exclusion.  2.21.  In cases when disciplinary procedures are being followed, exclusion may be  extended for four-week renewable periods until the completion of disciplinary  procedures if a return to work is considered inappropriate. The exclusion will  still only last for four weeks at a time and be subject to review. The exclusion  will usually be lifted and the practitioner allowed back to work, with or without  conditions placed upon the employment, as soon as the original reasons for  exclusion no longer apply.  2.22.  If the case manager considers that the exclusion will need to be extended  over a prolonged period outside of his or her control (for example because of  a police investigation), the case must be referred to the NCAS for advice as to  whether the case is being handled in the most effective way and suggestions  as to possible ways forward. However, even during this prolonged period the  principle of four-week \"renewability\" must be adhered to.  2.23.  If at any time after the practitioner has been excluded from work, investigation  reveals that either the allegations are without foundation or that further  investigation can continue with the practitioner working normally or with  restrictions, the case manager must lift the exclusion, inform the SHA and  make arrangements for the practitioner to return to work with any appropriate  support as soon as practicable.     TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  13 Exclusion from premises  2.24.  Practitioners will not be automatically barred from the premises upon  exclusion from work. The case manager must always consider whether a bar  from the premises is absolutely necessary. There are certain circumstances,  however, where the practitioner should be excluded from the premises. This  could be, for example, where there may be a danger of tampering with  evidence, or where the practitioner may be a serious potential danger to  patients or other staff. In other circumstances, however, there may be no  reason to exclude the practitioner from the premises.  Keeping in contact and availability for work  2.25.  The practitioner should be allowed to retain contact with colleagues, take part  in clinical audit and to remain up to date with developments in their field of  practice or to undertake research or training.  2.26. Exclusion under this procedure will be on full pay, therefore the practitioner  must remain available for work with their employer during their normal  contracted hours. The practitioner must inform the case manager of any other  organisation(s) with whom they undertake either voluntary or paid work and  seek their case manager\\'s consent to continuing to undertake such work or to  take annual leave or study leave. The practitioner should be reminded of  these contractual obligations but would be given 24 hours notice to return to  work. In exceptional circumstances the case manager may decide that  payment is not justified because the practitioner is no longer available for  work (e.g. abroad without agreement).  2.27.  The case manager should make arrangements to ensure that the practitioner  can keep in contact with colleagues on professional developments, and take  part in Continuing Professional development (CPD) and clinical audit activities  with the same level of support as other doctors or dentists in their  employment. A mentor could be appointed for this purpose if a colleague is  willing to undertake this role.  Informing other organisations  2.28.  In cases where there is concern that the practitioner may be a danger to  patients, the Trust may considere that it has an obligation to inform such other  organisations including the private sector, of any restriction on practice or  exclusion and provide a summary of the reasons for it. Details of other  employers (NHS and non-NHS) may be readily available from job plans, but  where it is not the practitioner should supply them. Failure to do so may result  in further disciplinary action or referral to the relevant regulatory body, as the  paramount interest is the safety of patients. Where a NHS employer has  placed restrictions on practice, the practitioner should agree not to undertake  any work in that area of practice with any other employer.  2.29.  Where the case manager believes that the practitioner is practising in other  parts of the NHS or in the private sector in breach or defiance of an  undertaking not to do so, he or she should contact the professional regulatory  body and the Director of Public Health or Medical Director of the Strategic  Health Authority to consider the issue of an alert letter.        TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  14 Informal exclusion  2.30.  No practitioner will be excluded from work other than through this new  procedure. The Trust will not use \"gardening leave\" or other informal  arrangements as a means of resolving a problem covered by this procedure.  Existing suspensions & transitional arrangements   2.31.  At the time of implementation of this procedure, any informal exclusions (e.g.  “gardening leave”) must be transferred to the new system of exclusion and  dealt with under the arrangements set out in this framework.  2.32.  A case manager will be appointed for each existing case and a review  conducted of the need for the suspension as in paragraph 2.34 below. In  cases where exclusion is considered to be necessary, the new system will  apply and the exclusion will be covered by the four-week review rule set out  below. The new exclusion will run for four weeks in the first instance.  Keeping Exclusions Under Review: Informing the Board  2.33.  The Board must be informed about an exclusion at the earliest opportunity.  The Board has a responsibility to ensure that the organisation\\'s internal  procedures are being followed. Therefore:  •  A summary of the progress of each case at the end of each period of  exclusion will be provided to the Board, demonstrating that procedures  are being correctly followed and that all reasonable efforts are being  made to bring the situation to an end as quickly as possible;   •  A monthly statistical summary showing all exclusions with their duration  and number of times the exclusion had been reviewed and extended will  be provided with a copy sent to the Strategic Health Authority.   Regular review  2.34.  The case manager must review the exclusion before the end of each four  week period and report the outcome to the Chief Executive and the Board.  This report is advisory and it would be for the case manager to decide on the  next steps as appropriate. The exclusion should usually be lifted and the  practitioner allowed back to work, with or without conditions placed upon the  employment, at any time the original reasons for exclusion no longer apply  and there are no other reasons for exclusion. The exclusion will lapse and the  practitioner will be entitled to return to work at the end of the four-week period  if the exclusion is not actively reviewed. It is important to recognise that Board  members might be required to sit as members of a future disciplinary or  appeal panel. Therefore, information to the Board should only be sufficient to  enable the Board to satisfy itself that the procedures are being followed. Only  the designated Board member should be involved to any significant degree in  each review. Careful consideration must be given as to whether the interests  of patients, other staff, the practitioner, and/or the needs of the investigative  process continue to necessitate exclusion and give full consideration to the  option of the practitioner returning to limited or alternative duties where  practicable.  2.35.  The Trust must take review action before the end of each 4-week period.  After three exclusions, the NCAS must be called in. The information below  outlines the activities that must be undertaken at different stages of exclusion.    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  15 2.36. The Trust will use the same timeframes to review any restrictions on practice  that have been placed on a practitioner, although the requirements for  reporting to the Board and Strategic Health Authority do not apply in these  circumstances.  First and second reviews (and reviews after the third review)   2.37. Before the end of each exclusion (of up to 4 weeks) the case manager must  review the position.  •  The case manager decides on next steps as appropriate, taking into  account the views of the practitioner. Further renewal may be for up to 4  weeks;   •  The case manager submits an advisory report of outcome to Chief  Executive and the Trust Board;  •  Each renewal is a formal matter and must be documented as such;  •  The practitioner must be sent written notification on each occasion.  Third review    2.38. If the practitioner has been excluded for three periods:  •  A report must be made to the Chief Executive outlining the reasons for the  continued exclusion, why restrictions on practice would not be an  appropriate alternative, and if the investigation has not been completed, a  timetable for completion of the investigation;  •  The Chief Executive must report to the Strategic Health Authority (SHA)  (see paragraph 2.42) and the designated Board member (see paragraphs  2.43-2.45);   •  The case must formally be referred to the NCAS explaining why continued  exclusion is appropriate and what steps are being taken to conclude the  exclusion, at the earliest opportunity;  •  The NCAS will review the case with the SHA and advise the Trust on the  handling of the case until it is concluded.   6 months review   2.39. If the exclusion has been extended over six months:  •  A further position report must be made by the Chief Executive to the SHA  indicating the reason for continuing the exclusion, the anticipated time  scale for completing the process and the actual and anticipated costs of  exclusion;  •  The SHA will form a view as to whether the case is proceeding at an  appropriate pace and in the most effective manner and whether there is  any advice they can offer to the Board.   2.40.  There will be a normal maximum limit of 6 months exclusion, except for those  cases involving criminal investigations of the practitioner concerned. The  employer and the NCAS will actively review such cases at least every six  months.    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  16 Appeal  2.41. At any stage when a practitioner is suspended or has restrictions placed on  their practice, they may appeal to a panel convened by the Trust. Once an  appeal has been heard, the practitioner will not be allowed to appeal again for  a period of [3] months. The panel will consist of a Trust Executive Director  appointed by the medical director (to chair the panel), a consultant appointed  by the [Medical Staff Committee] and a third member from the same specialty  and grade as the suspended practitioner from outside the Trust. The panel  will recommend to the Chief Executive whether the exclusion or restriction  should continue or be lifted.  The role of the SHA in monitoring exclusions  2.42.  When an exclusion decision has been extended twice, the Chief Executive of  the Trust (or a nominated officer) must inform the SHA of what action is  proposed to resolve the situation. This will include dates for hearings or give  reasons for the delay. Where retraining or other rehabilitation action is  proposed, the reason for continued exclusion must be given.  The role of the Board and designated member  2.43.  Board members may be required to sit as members of a disciplinary or appeal  panel. Therefore, information given to the Board should only be sufficient to  enable the Board to satisfy itself that the procedures are being followed. Only  the designated Board member should be involved to any significant degree in  each review.  2.44.  The Board is responsible for designating one of its non-executive members  as a “designated Board member\" under these procedures. The designated  Board member is the person who oversees the case manager and  investigating manager during the investigation process and maintains  momentum of the process.  2.45.  This member\\'s responsibilities include:  •  Receiving reports and reviewing the continued exclusion from work;   •  Considering representations from the practitioner about his or her  exclusion;   •  Considering any representations about the investigation;   Return To Work  2.46.   If it is decided that the exclusion should come to an end, there must be formal  arrangements for the return to work of the practitioner. It must be clear  whether clinical and other responsibilities are to remain unchanged or what  the duties and restrictions are to be and any monitoring arrangements to  ensure patient safety.        TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  17 3  CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINARY MATTERS     Introduction    3.1.  Misconduct matters for doctors and dentists, as for all other staff groups, are  dealt with under the Trust’s ‘Disciplinary Policy and Appeals Procedure’ TPP  402. However, where any concerns about the performance or conduct of a  medical practitioner are raised, the Trust will contact the National Clinical  Assessment Service (formerly NCAA) for advice before proceeding.      3.2.   Where the alleged misconduct being investigated under TPP402 relates to  matters of a professional nature, or where an investigation identifies issues of  professional conduct, the case investigator must obtain appropriate  independent professional advice. Similarly where a case involving issues of  professional conduct proceeds to a hearing under the employer’s conduct  procedures the panel must include a member who is medically qualified (in  the case of doctors) or dentally qualified (in the case of dentists) and who is  not currently employed by the organisation. The Trust will agree the selection  of the medical or dental panel member with the Medical Staff Committee.      3.3.  Both the Trust Policy TPP 402 – Disciplinary Policy and Appeals Procedure  and the GMC document Good Medical Practice  set out acceptable standards  of conduct and behaviour expected of  employees.  Breaches of these rules  are considered to be “misconduct” and examples are set out in the  procedures. Examples of issues that should be investigated under the Trust’s  Capability Procedure are set out below.     •  A refusal to comply with reasonable requirements of the employer.  •  An infringement of the employer’s disciplinary rules including conduct that  contravenes the standard of professional behaviour required by doctors  and dentists by their regulatory body.  •  The commision of criminal offences outside the place of work which may,  in particular circumstances, amount to misconduct.  •  wilful, careless, inappropriate or unethical behavoiur likely to compromise  standards of care or patient safety, or create serious disfunction to the  effective running of a service.    3.4   Examples of misconduct will vary greatly. Some examples are contained in  the Trust Policy TPP402.  The ACAS Code of Practice provides a non- exhaustive list of examples. Acts of misconduct may be simple and readily  recognised or more complex and involved. Examples may include  unreasonable or inappropriate behaviour such as verbal or physical bullying,  harassment and/or discrimination in the exercise of their duties towards  patients, the public or other employees. It could also include actions such as  deliberate falsification or fraud.    3.5.  Any allegation of misconduct against a doctor or dentist in recognised training  grades should be considered initially as a training issue and dealt with via the  educational supervisor and college or clinical tutor with close involvement of  the postgraduate dean from the outset.      TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  18 3.6.  Although it is for the Trust to decide upon the most appropriate way forward  having consulted the NCAS and their own employment law specialist, the  Trust will also consult with a representative of the Medical Staff Committee to  determine which procedure, if any, should be followed, in the event of a  dispute. The practitioner is also entitled to use the Trust’s grievance  procedure if they consider that the case has been incorrectly classified.  Alternatively or in addition he or she may make representations to the  designated board member.    3.7.  Failure to fulfil contractual obligations may also constitute misconduct. For  example, regular non-attendance at clinics or ward rounds, or not taking part  in clinical governance activities may come into this category. Additionally,  instances of failing to give proper support to other members of staff including  doctors or dentists in training may be considered in this category.        Action when investigations identify possible criminal acts    3.8.  Where an investigation establishes a suspected criminal action in the UK or  abroad, this will be reported to the police. The Trust investigation (under  either its Conduct or Capability Procedure) will only proceed in respect of  those aspects of the case which are not directly related to the police  investigation underway. The Trust will consult the police to establish whether  an investigation into any other matters would impede their investigation. In  cases of fraud, the Counter Fraud & Security Management Service will be  contacted.       Cases where criminal charges are brought not connected with an investigation  by Heatherwood & Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Trust    3.9.  There are some criminal offences that, if proven, could render a doctor or  dentist unsuitable for employment. In all cases, the Trust, having considered  the facts, will need to consider whether the employee poses a risk to patients  or colleagues and whether their conduct warrants instigating an investigation  and the exclusion of the practitioner. The Trust will have to give serious  consideration to whether the employee can continue in their job once criminal  charges have been made. Bearing in mind the presumption of innocence, the  Trust will consider whether the offence, if proven, is one that makes the  doctor or dentist unsuitable for their type of work and whether, pending the  trial, the employee can continue in their present job, should be allocated to  other duties or should be excluded from work. This will depend on the nature  of the offence and advice will be sought from the Trust’s legal adviser. The  Trust will explain the reasons for taking any such action to the practitioner  concerned.    Dropping of charges or no court conviction    3.10. When the Trust has refrained from taking action pending the outcome of a  court case, if the practitioner is acquitted but the employer feels there is  enough evidence to suggest a potential danger to patients, then the Trust has  a public duty to take action to ensure that the individual concerned does not  pose a risk to patient safety.  Similarly where there are insufficient grounds for  bringing charges or the court case is withdrawn there may be grounds for    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  19 considering police evidence where the allegations would, if proved, constitute  misconduct, bearing in mind that the evidence has not been tested in court. It  must be made clear to the police that any evidence they provide and is used  in the Trust’s case will have to be made available to the doctor or dentist  concerned. Where charges are dropped, the presumption is that the  employee will be reinstated.      Terms of Settlement on Termination of Employment    3.11. In some circumstances, terms of settlement may be agreed with a doctor or  dentist if their employment is to be terminated. The following principles will be  used by the Trust in such circumstances:    •  Settlement agreements must not be to the detriment of patient safety.   •  It is not acceptable to agree any settlement that precludes either  appropriate investigations being carried out and reports made or referral  to the appropriate regulatory body.   •  Payment will not normally be made when a member of staff’s  employment is terminated on disciplinary grounds or following the  resignation of the member of staff.  •  Expenditure on termination payments must represent value for money.  For example, the Trust should be able to defend the settlement on the  basis that it could conclude the matter at less cost than other options. A  clear record must be kept, setting out the calculations, assumptions and  rationale of all decisions taken, to show that the Trust or authority has  taken into account all relevant factors, including legal advice.  The audit  trail must also show that the matter has been considered and approved  by the remuneration committee and the Board. It must also be able to  stand up to district auditor and public scrutiny.  •  Offers of compensation, as an inducement to secure the voluntary  resignation of an individual, must not be used as an alternative to the  disciplinary process.   •  All job references must be accurate, realistic and comprehensive and  under no circumstance may they be misleading.   •  Where a termination settlement is agreed, details may be confirmed in a  Deed of Compromise that should set out what each party may say in  public or write about the settlement. The Deed of Compromise is for the  protection of each party, but it must not include clauses intended to cover  up inappropriate behaviour or inadequate services and should not include  the provision of an open reference. For the purposes of this paragraph,  an open reference is one that is prepared in advance of a request by a  prospective employer.            TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  20   4.   PROCEDURE FOR DEALING WITH ISSUES OF CAPABILITY    Introduction and General Principles    4.1.  There will be occasions where the Trust considers that there has been a clear  failure by an individual to deliver an adequate standard of care, or standard of  management, through lack of knowledge, ability or consistently poor  performance. These are described as capability issues. Matters that should  be described and dealt with as misconduct issues are covered in part 3 of this  procedure.         4.2.  Concerns about the capability of a doctor or dentist may arise from a single  incident or a series of events, reports or poor clinical outcomes.  Advice from  the NCAS will help the Trust to come to a decision on whether the matter  raises questions about the practitioner’s capability as an individual (health  problems, behavioural difficulties or lack of clinical competence) or whether  there are other matters that need to be addressed. If the concerns about  capability cannot be resolved routinely by management, the matter must be  referred to the NCAS before the matter can be considered by a capability  panel (unless the practitioner refuses to have his or her case referred). The  Trust will also involve the NCAS in all other potential disciplinary cases.    4.3.  Matters which fall under the Trust’s capability procedures include:    •  Out of date clinical practice;  •  Inappropriate clinical practice arising from a lack of knowledge or skills  that puts patients at risk;  •  Incompetent clinical practice;  •  Inability to communicate effectively with colleagues and/or patients;  •  Inappropriate delegation of clinical responsibility;  •  Inadequate supervision of delegated clinical tasks;  •  Ineffective clinical team working skills.    This is not an exhaustive list.    4.4.  Wherever possible, the Trust will aim to resolve issues of capability (including  clinical competence and health) through ongoing assessment and support.  Early identification of problems is essential to reduce the risk of serious harm  to patients. The NCAS will be consulted for advice to support the remediation  of a doctor or dentist.    How to proceed where conduct and capability issues involved    4.5.  It is inevitable that some cases will cover conduct and capability issues. It is  recognised that these cases can be complex and difficult to manage. If a case  covers more than one category of problem, they should usually be combined  under a capability hearing although there may be occasions where it is  necessary to pursue a conduct issue separately. Although it is for the Trust to  decide upon the most appropriate way forward having consulted the NCAS  and their own employment law specialist, the Trust will also consult with a  representative of the Medical Staff Committee/Local Negotiating Committee  to determine which procedure, if any, should be followed, in the event of a  dispute. The practitioner is also entitled to use the Trust’s grievance    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  21 procedure if they consider that the case has been incorrectly classified.  Alternatively or in addition he or she may make representations to the  designated board member.     Duties of Employers    4.6.  The procedures set out below are designed to cover issues where a doctor’s  or dentist’s capability to practise is in question. Prior to instigating these  procedures, the employer will consider the scope for resolving the issue  through counselling or retraining and will take advice from the NCAS.    4.7.  Capability may be affected by ill health and this will be considered in any  investigation. Arrangements for handling concerns about a practitioner’s  health are described in part 5 of this procedure.     4.8.  The Trust will ensure that investigations and capability procedures are  conducted in a way that does not discriminate on the grounds of race, gender,  disability or indeed on other grounds.    4.9.  The Trust will ensure that managers and case investigators receive  appropriate and effective training in the operation of this procedure. Those  undertaking investigations or sitting on capability or appeals panels must  have had formal equal opportunities training before undertaking such duties.  The Trust Board will agree what training staff and Board members must have  completed before they can take a part in these proceedings.      The pre-hearing process    4.10. When a report of the Trust investigation under part 1 of the procedure has  been received, the case manager must give the practitioner the opportunity to  comment in writing on the factual content of the report produced by the case  investigator.  Comments in writing from the practitioner, including any  mitigation, must normally be submitted to the case manager within 10 working  days of the date of receipt of the request for comments. In exceptional  circumstances, for example in complex cases or due to annual leave, the  deadline for comments from the practitioner should be extended.    4.11. The case manager should decide what further action is necessary, taking into  account the findings of the report, any comments that the practitioner has  made and the advice of the NCAS. The case manager will need to consider  urgently:     •  Whether action under Part 2 of the procedure is necessary to  exclude the practitioner; or   •  To place temporary restrictions on their clinical duties.      The case manager will also need to consider with the Medical Director and  Human Resources Director whether the issues of capability can be resolved  through local action (such as retraining, counselling, performance review). If  this action is not practicable for any reason the matter must be referred to the  NCAS for it to consider whether an assessment should be carried out and to  provide assistance in drawing up an action plan. The case manager will  inform the practitioner concerned of the decision immediately and normally  within 10 working days of receiving the practitioner’s comments.       TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  22 4.12.  The NCAS will assist the Trust in drawing up an action plan designed to  enable the practitioner to remedy any lack of capability that has been identified  during the assessment. The Trust must facilitate the agreed action plan (which has to  be agreed by the Trust and the practitioner before it can be actioned). There may be  occasions when a case has been considered by the NCAS, but the advice of its  assessment panel is that the practitioner’s performance is so fundamentally flawed  that no educational and/or organisational action plan has a realistic chance of  success.  In these circumstances, the case manager must make a decision, based  upon the completed investigation report and informed by the NCAS advice, whether  the case should be determined under the capability procedure. If so, a panel hearing  will be necessary.    4.13.  If the practitioner does not agree to the case being referred to the NCAS, a  panel hearing will normally be necessary.    4.14. If a capability hearing is to be held, the following procedure will be followed  beforehand:    •  The case manager must notify the practitioner in writing of the decision to  arrange a capability hearing.  This notification should be made at least 20  working days before the hearing and include details of the allegations  and the arrangements for proceeding including the practitioner’s rights to  be accompanied and copies of any documentation and/or evidence that  will be made available to the capability panel. This period will give the  practitioner sufficient notice to allow them to arrange for a companion to  accompany them to the hearing if they so choose;    •  All parties must exchange any documentation, including witness  statements, on which they wish to rely in the proceedings no later than 10  working days before the hearing. In the event of late evidence being  presented, the employer should consider whether a new date should be  set for the hearing;  •  Should either party request a postponement to the hearing the case  manager is responsible for ensuring that a reasonable response is made  and that time extensions to the process are kept to a minimum. The Trust  retains the right, after a reasonable period (not less than 30 working  days), to proceed with the hearing in the practitioner’s absence, although  the Trust will act reasonably in deciding to do so, taking into account any  comments made by the practitioner;  •  Should the practitioner’s ill health prevent the hearing taking place the  Trust will implement its usual absence procedures and involve the  Occupational Health Department as necessary;  •  Witnesses who have made written statements at the inquiry stage may,  but will not necessarily, be required to attend the capability hearing.   Following representations from either side contesting a witness statement  which is to be relied upon in the hearing, the Chairman will invite the  witness to attend. The Chairman cannot require anyone other than an  employee to attend.  However, if evidence is contested and the witness is  unable or unwilling to attend, the panel will reduce the weight given to the  evidence as there will not be the opportunity to challenge it properly. A  final list of witnesses to be called must be given to both parties not less  than two working days in advance of the hearing;  •  If witnesses who are required to attend the hearing choose to be  accompanied, the accompanying person cannot participate in the  hearing.    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  23   The hearing framework    4.15.  The capability hearing will be chaired by an Executive Director of the Trust.  The panel will comprise a total of 3 people, normally 2 members of the Trust  Board, or senior staff appointed by the Board for the purpose of the hearing.  At least one member of the panel must be a medical or dental practitioner,not  necessarily from the same specialty, who is not employed by the Trust. The  Trust will agree the external medical or dental member with the Chair of the  Medical Staff Committee     4.16. No member of the panel or advisers to the panel should have been previously  involved in carrying out the investigation.      4.17.  Arrangements must be made for the panel to be advised by:    •  A senior member of staff from Human Resources, and  •  A senior clinician from the same or similar clinical specialty as the  practitioner concerned from within the Trust, or from another NHS  employer.    It is important that the panel is aware of the typical standard of competence  required of the grade of doctor in question. If for any reason the senior  clinician is unable to advise on the appropriate level of competence, a doctor  from another NHS employer in the same grade as the practitioner in question  will be asked to provide advice.     4.18.  The practitioner may raise an objection to the choice of any panel member  within 5 working days of notification. The Trust will review the situation and  take reasonable measures to ensure that the membership of the panel is  acceptable to the practitioner. It may be necessary to postpone the hearing  while this matter is resolved. The Trust must provide the practitioner with the  reasons for reaching its decision in writing before the hearing can take place.    Representation at capability hearings    4.19. The practitioner will be given every reasonable opportunity to present his or  her case, although the hearing should not be conducted in a legalistic or  excessively formal manner.    4.20.  The practitioner may be represented in the process by a friend, partner or  spouse, colleague, or a representative who may be from or retained by a  trade union or defence organisation.  Such a representative may be legally  qualified but they will not be representing the practitioner formally in a legal  capacity.  The representative will be entitled to present a case on behalf of  the practitioner, address the panel and question the management case and  any witness evidence.    Conduct of the capability hearing    4.21. The hearing should be conducted as follows:    •  The panel and its advisers (see paragraph 4.18), the practitioner, his or  her representative and the case manager will be present at all times    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  24 during the hearing. Witnesses will be admitted only to give their evidence  and answer questions and will then retire;  •  The Chairman of the panel will be responsible for the proper conduct of  the proceedings. The Chairman should introduce all persons present and  announce which witnesses are available to attend the hearing;  •  The procedure for dealing with any witnesses attending the hearing shall  be the same and shall reflect the following:  o The witness to confirm any written statement and give any  supplementary evidence;  o The side calling the witness can question the witness;  o The other side can then question the witness;  o The panel may question the witness;  o The side which called the witness may seek to clarify any points  which have arisen during questioning but may not at this point  raise new evidence.    4.22. The order of presentation shall be:    •  The Case Manager presents the management case including calling any  witnesses. The above procedure for dealing with witnesses shall be  undertaken for each witness in turn, at the end of which each witness  shall be allowed to leave;  •  The Chairman shall invite the Case Manager to clarify any matters arising  from the management case on which the panel requires further  clarification.  •  The practitioner and/or their representative shall present the practitioner’s  case, calling any witnesses. The above procedure for dealing with  witnesses shall be undertaken for each witness in turn, at the end of  which each witness shall be allowed to leave;  •  The Chairman shall invite the practitioner and/or representative to clarify  any matters arising from the practitioner’s case on which the panel  requires further clarification;  •  The Chairman shall invite the Case Manager to make a brief closing  statement summarising the key points of the case;  •  The Chairman shall invite the practitioner and/or representative to make a  brief closing statement summarising the key points of the practitioner’s  case. Where appropriate this statement may also introduce any grounds  for mitigation;  •  The panel shall then retire to consider its decision.      Decisions    4.23. The panel will have the power to make a range of decisions including the  following:     •  No action required;  •  Oral agreement that there must be an improvement in clinical  performance within a specified time scale with a written statement of  what is required and how it might be achieved [stays on the employee’s  record for 6 months];  •  Written warning that there must be an improvement in clinical  performance within a specified time scale with a statement of what is  required and how it might be achieved [stays on the employees’ record    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  25 for 1 year];  •  Final written warning that there must be an improvement in clinical  performance within a specified time scale with a statement of what is  required and how it might be achieved [stays on the employee’s record  for 1 year];  •  Termination of contract.    It is also reasonable for the panel to make comments and recommendations  on issues other than the competence of the practitioner, where these issues  are relevant to the case. For example, there may be matters around the  systems and procedures operated by the employer that the panel wishes to  comment upon.    4.24. A record of oral agreements and written warnings should be kept on the  practitioner’s personnel file but will be removed following the specified period.     4.25. The decision of the panel will be communicated to the parties as soon as  possible and normally within 5 working days of the hearing.  Because of the  complexities of the issues under deliberation and the need for detailed  consideration, the parties should not necessarily expect a decision on the day  of the hearing.    4.26. The decision must be confirmed in writing to the practitioner. This notification  must include reasons for the decision, clarification of the practitioner’s right of  appeal and notification of any intent to make a referral to the GMC/GDC or  any other external/professional body.   Appeals in Capability Cases    4.27. The appeals procedure provides a mechanism for practitioners who disagree  with the outcome of a decision to have an opportunity for the case to be  reviewed. The appeal panel will need to establish whether the Trust’s  procedures have been adhered to and that the panel in arriving at their  decision acted fairly and reasonably based on:    •  A fair and thorough investigation of the issue;  •  Sufficient evidence arising from the investigation or assessment on which  to base the decision;  •  Whether in the circumstances the decision was fair and reasonable, and  commensurate with the evidence heard.    It can also hear new evidence submitted by the practitioner and consider  whether it might have significantly altered the decision of the original hearing.  The appeal panel, however, should not rehear the case in its entirety (but in  certain circumstances it may order a new hearing see 4.30).    4.28.  A dismissed practitioner will potentially be able to take their case to an  Employment Tribunal where the reasonableness of the Trust’s actions can be  tested.              TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  26 The appeal process    4.29. The predominant purpose of the appeal is to ensure that a fair hearing was  given to the original case and a fair and reasonable decision reached by the  hearing panel. The appeal panel has the power to confirm or vary the  decision made at the capability hearing, or order that the case is reheard.  Where it is clear in the course of the appeal hearing that the proper  procedures have not been followed and the appeal panel determines that the  case needs to be fully re-heard, the Chairman of the panel shall have the  power to instruct a new capability hearing.    4.30.  Where the appeal is against dismissal, the practitioner should not be paid  during the appeal, if it is heard after the date of termination of employment.   Should the appeal be upheld, the practitioner should be reinstated and must  be paid backdated to the date of termination of employment. Where the  decision is to rehear the case, the practitioner should also be reinstated,  subject to any conditions or restrictions in place at the time of the original  hearing, and paid backdated to the date of termination of employment.    The appeal panel    4.31. The panel will consist of three members. The members of appeal panel must  not have had any previous direct involvement in the matters that are the  subject of the appeal, for example they must not have acted as the  designated board member. These members will be:     •  An independent member (trained in legal aspects of appeals) from an  approved pool.  This person will be appointed from the national list held  by NHS Employers for this purpose (see Annex A to ‘Maintaining High  Professional Standards in the Modern NHS’). This person is designated  Chairman;  •  The Chairman (or other non-executive director) of the employing  organisation who must have the appropriate training for hearing an  appeal;  •  A medically qualified member (or dentally qualified if appropriate) who is  not employed by the Trust who must also have the appropriate training  for hearing an appeal. The Trust will agree the external medical or dental  member with the Chair of the Medical Staff Committee.      4.32.  The panel should call on others to provide specialist advice. This will include:    •  A consultant from the same specialty or subspecialty as the appellant, but  from another NHS employer. Where the case involves a dentist this may  be a consultant or an appropriate senior practitioner;  •  A senior human resources specialist who may be from another NHS  organisation.      It is important that the panel is aware of the typical standard of competence  required of the grade of doctor in question. If for any reason the senior  clinician is unable to advise on the appropriate level of competence, a doctor  from another NHS employer in the same grade as the practitioner in question  will be asked to provide advice.     4.33. The Trust should make the arrangements for the panel and notify the    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  27 appellant as soon as possible and in any event within the recommended  timetable in paragraph 4.35. The practitioner may raise an objection to the  choice of any panel member within 5 working days of notification. The Trust  will review the situation and take reasonable measures to ensure that the  membership of the panel is acceptable to the practitioner. It may be  necessary to postpone the hearing while this matter is resolved. The Trust  must provide the practitioner with the reasons for reaching its decision in  writing before the hearing can take place.    4.34.  It is in the interests of all concerned that appeals are heard speedily and as  soon as possible after the original capability hearing. The following timetable  will apply in all cases:    •  Appeal by written statement to be submitted to the designated appeal  point (normally the Director of Human Resources) within 25 working days  of the date of the written confirmation of the original decision;  •  Hearing to take place within 25 working days of date of lodging appeal;  •  Decision reported to the appellant and the Trust within 5 working days of  the conclusion of the hearing.    4.35. The timetable will be agreed between the Trust and the appellant and  thereafter varied only by mutual agreement. The case manager should be  informed and is responsible for ensuring that extensions are absolutely  necessary and kept to a minimum.     Powers of the appeal panel    4.36.  The appeal panel has the right to call witnesses of its own volition, but must  notify both parties at least 10 working days in advance of the hearing and  provide them with a written statement from any such witness at the same  time.    4.37. Exceptionally, where during the course of the hearing the appeal panel  determines that it needs to hear the evidence of a witness not called by either  party, then it shall have the power to adjourn the hearing to allow for a written  statement to be obtained from the witness and made available to both parties  before the hearing reassembles.    4.38. If, during the course of the hearing, the appeal panel determines that new  evidence needs to be presented, it should consider whether an adjournment  is appropriate.  Much will depend on the weight of the new evidence and its  relevance.  The appeal panel has the power to determine whether to consider  the new evidence as relevant to the appeal, or whether the case should be  reheard, on the basis of the new evidence, by a capability hearing panel.    Conduct of appeal hearing    4.39. All parties should have all documents, including witness statements, from the  previous capability hearing together with any new evidence.    4.40. The practitioner may be represented in the process by a friend, partner or  spouse, colleague or a representative who may be from or retained by a trade  union or defence organisation. Such a representative may be legally qualified  but they will not be representing the practitioner formally in a legal capacity.    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  28 The representative will be entitled to present a case on behalf of the  practitioner, address the panel and question the management case and any  written evidence.    4.41. Both parties will present full statements of fact to the appeal panel and will be  subject to questioning by either party, as well as the panel. When all the  evidence has been presented, both parties shall briefly sum up. At this stage,  no new information can be introduced.  The appellant (or his/her companion)  can at this stage make a statement in mitigation.    4.42.  The panel, after receiving the views of both parties, shall consider and make  its decision in private.    Decision    4.43.  The decision of the appeal panel shall be made in writing to the appellant and  shall be copied to the Trust’s case manager such that it is received within 5  working days of the conclusion of the hearing. The decision of the appeal  panel is final and binding. There shall be no correspondence on the decision  of the panel, except and unless clarification is required on what has been  decided (but not on the merits of the case), in which case it should be sought  in writing from the Chairman of the appeal panel.    Action following hearing    4.44.  Records must be kept, including a report detailing the capability issues, the  practitioner’s defence or mitigation, the action taken and the reasons for it.  These records must be kept confidential and retained in accordance with the  capability procedure and the Data Protection Act 1998. These records need  to be made available to those with a legitimate call upon them, such as the  practitioner, the Regulatory Body, or in response to a Direction from an  Employment Tribunal.    Termination of Employment with Performance Issue Unresolved  4.45. Where an employee leaves employment before disciplinary procedures have  been completed, any outstanding disciplinary investigation will be concluded  and capability proceedings will be completed where possible.     4.46.  Where employment ends before investigation or proceedings have been  concluded, every reasonable effort will be made to ensure the former  employee remains involved in the process. If contact with the employee has  been lost, the Trust will invite them to attend any hearing by writing to both  their last known home address and their registered address (the two will often  be the same). The Trust will make a judgement, based on the evidence  available, as to whether the allegations about the practitioner’s capability are  upheld. If the allegations are upheld, the Trust will take appropriate action,  such as requesting the issue of an alert letter and referral to the professional  regulatory body (GMC/GDC), referral to the police, or the Protection of  Children Act List (held by the Department for Education and Skills).     4.47. If an excluded employee or an employee facing capability proceedings  becomes ill, they will be subject to the Trust’s [name of sickness absence  procedures].  The sickness absence procedures take precedence over the  capability procedures and the Trust will take reasonable steps to give the    TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  29 employee time to recover and attend any hearing. Where the employee\\'s  illness exceeds 4 weeks, they must be referred to the Occupational Health  Service. The Occupational Health Service will advise the Trust on the  expected duration of the illness and any consequences it may have for the  capability process and will also be able to advise on the employee\\'s capacity  for future work, as a result of which the Trust may wish to consider retirement  on health grounds. Should employment be terminated as a result of ill health,  the investigation should still be taken to a conclusion and the Trust form a  judgement as to whether the allegations are upheld.    4.48. If, in exceptional circumstances, a hearing proceeds in the absence of the  practitioner, for reasons of ill-health, the practitioner will have the opportunity  to submit written submissions and/or have a representative attend in his or  her absence.    4.49.  Where a case involves allegations of abuse against a child, the guidance  issued to the NHS in September 2000, called “The Protection of Children Act  1999 – A Practical Guide to the Act for all Organisations Working with  Children” gives more detailed information. A copy can be found on the  Department of Health website (www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics).       TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  30 5.   HANDLING CONCERNS ABOUT A PRACTITIONER’S HEALTH    Introduction    5.1.  A wide variety of health problems can have an impact on an individual’s  clinical performance. These conditions may arise spontaneously or be as a  consequence of work place factors such as stress.  5.2.  The Trust’s key principle for dealing with individuals with health problems is  that, wherever possible and consistent with reasonable public protection, they  should be treated, rehabilitated or re-trained (for example if they cannot  undertake exposure prone procedures) and kept in employment, rather than  be lost from the NHS.   Retaining the services of individuals with health problems    5.3.  Wherever possible the Trust will attempt to continue to employ individuals  provided this does not place patients or colleagues at risk. In particular, the  Trust will consider the following actions for staff with ill-health problems:    •  Sick leave for the practitioner (the practitioner to be contacted frequently  on a pastoral basis to stop them feeling isolated);  •  Remove the practitioner from certain duties;  •  Reassign them to a different area of work;  •  Arrange re-training or adjustments to their working environment, with  appropriate advice from the National Clinical Assessment Service and/or  deanery, under the reasonable adjustment provisions in the Disability  Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA).     This is not an exhaustive list    Reasonable adjustment    5.4.  At all times the practitioner will be supported by the Trust and the  Occupational Health Service (OHS) which will ensure that the practitioner is  offered every available resource to get back to practise where appropriate.  The Trust will consider what reasonable adjustments could be made to their  workplace or other arrangements, in line with the DDA. In particular, it will  consider:    •  Making adjustments to the premises;  •  Re-allocating some of a disabled person’s duties to another;  •  Transferring  an employee to an existing vacancy;  •  Altering an employee’s working hours or pattern of work;  •  Assigning the employee to a different workplace;  •  Allowing absence for rehabilitation, assessment or treatment;  •  Providing additional training or retraining;  •  Acquiring/modifying equipment;  •  Modifying procedures for testing or assessment;  •  Providing a reader or interpreter;  •  Establishing mentoring arrangements.        TPP 408 – Medical & Dental Disciplinary Policy  31 5.5.  In some cases retirement due to ill health may be necessary. Ill health  retirement should be approached in a reasonable and considerate manner, in  line with NHS Pensions Agency advice. However, any issues relating to  conduct or capability that have arisen will be resolved, using the appropriate  agreed procedures.     Handling Health Issues    5.6.  Where there is an incident that points to a problem with the practitioner’s  health, the incident may need to be investigated to determine a health  problem. If the report recommends OHS involvement, the nominated  manager must immediately refer the practitioner to a qualified occupational  physician (usually a consultant) with the Occupational Health Service.     5.7.  The NCAS should be approached to offer advice on any situation and at any  point where the employer is concerned about a doctor or dentist. Even  apparently simple or early concerns should be referred as these are easier to  deal with before they escalate.     5.8.  The occupational physician should agree a course of action with the  practitioner and send his/her recommendations to the Medical Director and a  meeting should be convened with the Director of HR, the Medical Director or  case manager, the practitioner and case worker from the OHS to agree a  timetable of action and rehabilitation The practitioner may wish to bring a  support companion to these meetings. This could be a family member, a  colleague or a trade union or defence association representative.   Confidentiality must be maintained by all parties at all times.    5.9.  If a doctor or dentist’s ill health makes them a danger to patients and they do  not recognise that, or are not prepared to co-operate with measures to protect  patients, then exclusion from work and referral to the professional regulatory  body must be considered, irrespective of whether or not they have retired on  the grounds of ill health.    5.10. In those cases where there is impairment of performance solely due to ill  health, disciplinary procedures will be considered only in the most exceptional  of circumstances, for example if the individual concerned refuses to co- operate with the employer to resolve the underlying situation e.g. by  repeatedly refusing a referral to the OHS or the NCAS. In these  circumstances the procedures in part 4 should be followed.      5.11. There will be circumstances where an employee who is subject to disciplinary  proceedings puts forward a case, on health grounds, that the proceedings  should be delayed, modified or terminated. In such cases the Trust will refer  the doctor or dentist to the OHS for assessment as soon as possible.   Unreasonable refusal to accept a referral to, or to co-operate with, the OHS  under these circumstances, may give separate grounds for pursuing  disciplinary action.    5.12. Special Professional Panels (generally referred to as the “three wise men”)  were set up by under circular HC(82)13.  This part of the procedure replaces  HC(82)13 which is cancelled.
